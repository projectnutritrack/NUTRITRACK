# NutriTrack – ML-Based Calorie Prediction System

NutriTrack is a machine learning–based application that predicts the approximate calorie content of food based on user input. The project aims to help users make informed dietary decisions in a simple and accessible way.

## Problem Statement
Many people are unaware of the calorie content of the food they consume daily. NutriTrack addresses this by providing quick calorie predictions using a trained ML model, making nutrition awareness easier for users.

## Features
- User-friendly input for food details
- Machine learning–based calorie prediction
- Simple and interactive interface
- Fast and lightweight application

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- JAVASCRIPT
- REACT

## How It Works
1. The user enters food-related input (such as quantity or relevant parameters).
2. The input data is processed and passed to the trained ML model.
3. The model predicts the estimated calorie value.
4. The result is displayed instantly to the user.
